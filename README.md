## üìÅ Projects Included

Each project is built independently and follows layered architecture for clean separation of concerns:

- `WeatherApp.GraphQLApi.ApiKeyAuth` ‚Äì GraphQL API secured via static API Key.
- `WeatherApp.GraphQLApi.JwtAuth` ‚Äì GraphQL API secured using JSON Web Tokens.
- `WeatherApp.GraphQLApi.OAuth2Firebase` ‚Äì GraphQL API secured using OAuth2 with Firebase provider.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

Each project has its own solution file and can be run/tested independently.

### üß± Clone the Repository

    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/weather-app.auth-graphql-apis.layered.git
        cd weather-app.auth-graphql-apis.layered
    ```


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Any Project

    ```bash
        cd WeatherApp.GraphQLApi.JwtAuth
        dotnet run
    ```
        
     Replace JwtAuth with any of the other folders as needed.


## üîé Explore GraphQL Playground
    Each project exposes the default HotChocolate GraphQL IDE Banana Cake Pop at:

    ```bash
        http://localhost:5000/graphql
    ```
    You can explore schema, make authenticated queries, and test authorization.



## üß™ Test Scenarios
    Each project includes a Docs/TestMe.md file with example queries and test scenarios specific to the authentication scheme in use.
